# Mineport
My futile attempt to bring Minecraft to Minetest.

The idea is that I want to make a Minecraft game/mod that plays hopefully very close to Minecraft. I also want this to be command-compatible. You can expect a certain block in this game to have the same in-code name as Minecraft and do something like "/giveme mineport:cobblestone". This means that everything will be packaged in one mod. Hopefully this won't be too hard to make.

# TODOs
1. Finish the group setup.
2. Figure out how to make the "Plains" biome look like one.
3. ~~Come up with a new name~~ and change the texture to avoid copyright freakery. Might need a texture designer for this.
